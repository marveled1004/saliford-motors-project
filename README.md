Providing data-driven suggestions for HR
This project was developed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Course â€“ Capstone Project (Course 7)**.  
The dataset used, `HR_capstone_dataset.csv`, is also provided through the course.

The main objective of this project is to address the business question:  
*"What factors are most likely to cause an employee to leave the company?"*

To answer this question, the project follows a four-step process:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**  
   Initial analysis and preprocessing to understand the structure and quality of the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Using visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.

3. **Model Construction**  
   Building and comparing three classification models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

4. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**  
   After identifying XGBoost as the best-performing model, its predictions will be interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Beeswarm plot and built-in feature importance graph.

This structured approach aims to provide actionable insights into employee turnover and support data-driven decision-making for improving retention.
